        <span>Hi! My name is John Chong and I'm a prospective software engineer! Born and raised in</span>
        <span> San Jose, CA, I'm very familiar with beautiful weather and overpriced gas. I was in the Bay Area</span>
        <span> for the first 21 years of my life; I also spent my undergrad years at UC Berkeley where I studied Data Science.</span>
        <span> Shortly after graduating, I found myself relocating to St.Louis, Missouri for work where I wanted to spend some time outside of the</span>
        <span> bubble I grew up around and I have been thoroughly enjoying the past 2 years in the Midwest.</span>
        <span> Before realizing I wanted to pursue this software engineer career I worked as an actuary: actuaries specialize in risk management</span>
        <span> and statistics to reasonably project future losses for companies. In other words, I worked in a consulting firm whose clients are insurance companies.</span>
        <span> After working in that industry for around 1.5 years, I realized that I wasn't really being challenged in a technical standpoint</span>
        <span> and that the projected path of the actuarial career wasn't a fit for me. So while it was a big decision,</span>
        <span> it wasn't a hard decision to try something new and explore a new field while I still had the ability and time to.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>But enough of my career, to prove to you that I'm a regular human being I do have interests that I would love to share with you!</span>
        <span> I'm a HUGE basketball fan; I was a little late when I started watching in 2017, but I'm proudly a part of Laker Nation.</span>
        <span> It might be weird given that I'm from the Bay Area, but that's something you can ask about later. While I may not be the best,</span>
        <span> I really enjoy playing basketball with friends or in pickup. Being the active guy I am, I also played volleyball</span>
        <span> in high school and enjoy working out and running. I do consider LeBron James the GOAT of basketball, so we can open that can of worms another time as well.</span>
        <span> In contrast with my outdoor inclinations, I'm also a huge coffee fanatic; I enjoy brewing my own coffee, visitng cafes, and exploring new brewing methods and beans.</span>
        <span> You can take a look at the playlist I've compiled that I love to brew with (Apple Music guy here, #sorrynotsorry). Besides coding,</span>
        <span> I've recently be into a lot of reading; typically theological books, productivity books, or inspirational autobiographies; I'm appreciating the concept of winding down.</span>
        <span> Maybe it comes with age? Regardless, there's only so much a personal website can do with introductions, but I'm really glad you got all the way down here.</span>
        <span> I'm looking forward to connecting with you in the near future and feel free to check out my resume!</span>
